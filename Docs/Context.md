# **AnxLight: Comprehensive Project Documentation**

*Last Updated: 2025-06-27*

## **Chapter 1: Project Introduction**

### **1.1. Project AnxLight: Overview and Vision**

AnxLight is a multifaceted project designed to streamline the setup, configuration, and launch of various Stable Diffusion WebUIs and associated tools. Originating as a fork of the anxety-solo/sdAIgen repository, AnxLight's primary objective is to evolve beyond the original script-based workflow by introducing a modern, user-friendly Gradio interface and a more robust, modular backend architecture.

The core vision is to create a centralized, easy-to-use platform that abstracts away the complexities of environment setup and asset management, allowing users to focus on their creative work.

### **1.2. Core Goals and Objectives**

* **Modern User Interface:** Replace the traditional IPython notebook execution flow with a comprehensive Gradio-based user interface for all configuration and launch operations.  
* **Simplified User Experience:** Provide a user-friendly way to select a WebUI, configure its settings, download necessary assets (models, VAEs, extensions), and launch the application.  
* **Architectural Refactor:** Implement the \"v3\" architecture, which separates heavy, one-time setup from lighter, session-based operations for faster and more efficient launches.  
* **Modularity and Reusability:** Refactor existing backend scripts to be independent, reusable modules that can be orchestrated by the main application, improving maintainability and extensibility.

### **1.3. Multi-Platform Strategy**

A key objective is to ensure AnxLight is adaptable for use across a diverse range of environments. This includes:

* **Cloud Notebooks:** Google Colab, Kaggle.  
* **Cloud Computing Platforms:** Vast.ai, Lightning AI, RunPod.  
* Local Setups: Native installations on personal machines.  
  This strategy requires careful management of file paths, environment configurations, and installation procedures to ensure a consistent experience on any platform.

### **1.4. Scope and Language Focus**

Development prioritizes English-language versions of all components. Russian-specific files (e.g., widgets-ru.py, downloading-ru.py) from the original anxety-solo/sdAIgen repository are considered out of scope and will be ignored or removed. The focus is on creating new, language-agnostic components wherever possible.

4. **Update the Scope and Language Focus (Section 1.4):** Clearly state that development is English-only and that Russian-language files from the original repository are out of scope.  
5. Maintain a clear, concise, and professional tone throughout.

## **Chapter 2: The \"v3\" Architecture**

### **2.1. Architectural Philosophy**

The \"v3\" architecture represents a fundamental shift from the sequential script execution model of anxety-solo/sdAIgen. The new philosophy is centered on a clear separation of concerns, managed by a central Gradio UI. This design distinguishes between heavy, one-time installation tasks (Pre-Flight Setup) and the lighter, session-specific tasks of configuration and launching.

### **2.2. Key Components (As of 2025-06-26)**

* **1\\. Platform Entry Point (notebook/AnxLight\\_Launcher\\_v\\*.ipynb):** This is the user's starting point, simplified to a versioned, two-cell notebook.  
  * **Cell 1: Pre-Flight Setup:** Clones/updates the AnxLight repository and executes the main setup script (scripts/pre\\_flight\\_setup.py) to perform all heavy, non-interactive tasks like VENV creation, dependency installation, and cloning WebUI repositories. This step is run once per environment.  
  * **Cell 2: Application Launch:** Executes the main Gradio application (scripts/main\\_gradio\\_app.py) within the created VENV, starting the user's interactive session.  
* **2\\. Pre-Flight Setup Script (scripts/pre\\_flight\\_setup.py):** This script is the workhorse for initial environment preparation. It handles installing system packages, creating a Python Virtual Environment (VENV), installing all core dependencies, and calling the individual, refactored WebUI installers from scripts/UIs/.  
* **3\\. The Gradio User Interface (scripts/main\\_gradio\\_app.py):** This is the core of the AnxLight user experience. It serves as the configuration manager and application orchestrator. Its responsibilities include:  
  * Reading and writing user selections to a anxlight\\_config.json file.  
  * Handling session-specific asset downloads (models, LoRAs, etc.) using modules/Manager.py.  
  * Displaying configuration options to the user in a graphical interface, using data from scripts/data/\\*.py.  
  * Executing the final launch command for the selected WebUI via scripts/launch.py.  
* **4\\. Core UI Installers (scripts/UIs/\\*.py):** The original scripts responsible for installing specific WebUIs have been refactored. All IPython-specific code has been removed, and shell commands are now executed using Python's standard subprocess module. This makes them callable from any Python script, decoupling them from the notebook environment.  
* **5\\. Versioning Script (scripts/anxlight\\_version.py):** A new script that acts as the single source of truth for all component version numbers (e.g., ANXLIGHT\\_OVERALL\\_SYSTEM\\_VERSION, MAIN\\_GRADIO\\_APP\\_VERSION).  
* **6\\. Data Modules (scripts/data/\\*.py):** Consolidated data sources for assets (e.g., sd15\\_data.py, sdxl\\_data.py), keeping asset information separate from the main application logic.

### **2.3. Divergence from anxety-solo/sdAIgen**

The AnxLight v3 architecture is a significant and deliberate departure from its predecessor:

| Feature | anxety-solo/sdAIgen (Original) | AnxLight (v3) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User Interface** | IPython notebook cells executing Python scripts sequentially. | A unified Gradio application launched from a simple two-cell notebook. |
| **Setup Flow** | A monolithic downloading-en.py script handles most tasks. | A two-stage process: pre\\_flight\\_setup.py for heavy installs and main\\_gradio\\_app.py for session tasks. |
| **Modularity** | Tightly coupled scripts dependent on the notebook environment. | Decoupled, reusable scripts orchestrated by the main Gradio app. Scripts are refactored to use standard Python modules like subprocess. |
| **Versioning** | No centralized version tracking. | A dedicated scripts/anxlight\\_version.py file serves as the single source of truth for the project version. |
| **Configuration** | State managed implicitly through notebook execution order. | Explicit state managed via a anxlight\\_config.json file for persistence across sessions. |

### **LLM Update Prompt**

**SYSTEM PROMPT:** You are an AI assistant tasked with updating the \"v3 Architecture\" chapter for the AnxLight project. Your goal is to explain the technical architecture to a developer.

**Instructions:**

1. **Update the Architectural Philosophy (Section 2.1):** Explain that v3 moves away from a linear script execution model to a separated one: a one-time \"pre-flight setup\" for heavy installs and a session-based Gradio app for configuration and launch.  
2. **Update the Key Components (Section 2.2):** Detail the main parts of the system based on the latest information. Be sure to list and describe the purpose of the launcher notebook, pre\\_flight\\_setup.py, main\\_gradio\\_app.py, the refactored UI installers (scripts/UIs/\\*.py), the versioning script, and the data modules.  
3. **Update the Divergence Table (Section 2.3):** Recreate the Markdown table comparing anxety-solo/sdAIgen with AnxLight (v3) across key features: UI, Setup Flow, Modularity, Versioning, and Configuration. Ensure the descriptions are concise and accurate.  
4. Use code formatting for file paths and names (e.g., \\`scripts/main\\_gradio\\_app.py\\`).

5. Structure the output using distinct phases and bullet points for clarity.

## **Chapter 4: Technical Deep Dive**

### **4.1. Configuration Management (anxlight\\_config.json)**

The anxlight\\_config.json file is central to the v3 architecture. It acts as a persistent state holder for the user's selections in the Gradio UI. This allows the application to remember settings across sessions and decouples the configuration from the execution logic. The Gradio app reads this file on startup to populate the UI and writes to it whenever the user makes changes.

### **4.2. Versioning**

To maintain clarity and control over the project's evolution, a simple versioning system has been established. The file scripts/anxlight\\_version.py contains the current version string, acting as the single source of truth that can be imported and displayed within the application.

### **4.3. Operational Patterns & Known Issues**

*   **Colab Subprocess Unreliability:** Launching the Gradio server from a Colab notebook using Python's `subprocess.Popen` with redirected I/O (`stdout=subprocess.PIPE`) is highly unreliable and prone to silent hangs. This is likely due to how Colab handles I/O buffering and TTY allocation for child processes.
    *   **Verified Problem:** A `main_gradio_app.py` script that was proven to be perfectly functional when run from a direct shell (`!python ...`) would consistently hang when launched via `subprocess.Popen` in a notebook cell.
    *   **Recommended Solution:** To ensure stability, avoid using Python's `subprocess` module to launch the Gradio server from a notebook. Instead, use a more direct method:
        1.  **Direct Shell Execution (Preferred):** Use IPython's shell magic (`!`) to run the launch command directly (e.g., `!python scripts/main_gradio_app.py`).
        2.  **Patched Launcher Script:** As a robust alternative, create a temporary launcher script within the notebook cell that imports and runs the main application. This contains the problem within the cell and avoids the `subprocess` fragility.
