# **AnxLight: Comprehensive Project Documentation**\n\n*Last Updated: 2025-06-26*\n\n## **Chapter 1: Project Introduction**\n\n### **1.1. Project AnxLight: Overview and Vision**\n\nAnxLight is a multifaceted project designed to streamline the setup, configuration, and launch of various Stable Diffusion WebUIs and associated tools. Originating as a fork of the anxety-solo/sdAIgen repository, AnxLight's primary objective is to evolve beyond the original script-based workflow by introducing a modern, user-friendly Gradio interface and a more robust, modular backend architecture.\n\nThe core vision is to create a centralized, easy-to-use platform that abstracts away the complexities of environment setup and asset management, allowing users to focus on their creative work.\n\n### **1.2. Core Goals and Objectives**\n\n* **Modern User Interface:** Replace the traditional IPython notebook execution flow with a comprehensive Gradio-based user interface for all configuration and launch operations.  \n* **Simplified User Experience:** Provide a user-friendly way to select a WebUI, configure its settings, download necessary assets (models, VAEs, extensions), and launch the application.  \n* **Architectural Refactor:** Implement the \"v3\" architecture, which separates heavy, one-time setup from lighter, session-based operations for faster and more efficient launches.  \n* **Modularity and Reusability:** Refactor existing backend scripts to be independent, reusable modules that can be orchestrated by the main application, improving maintainability and extensibility.\n\n### **1.3. Multi-Platform Strategy**\n\nA key objective is to ensure AnxLight is adaptable for use across a diverse range of environments. This includes:\n\n* **Cloud Notebooks:** Google Colab, Kaggle.  \n* **Cloud Computing Platforms:** Vast.ai, Lightning AI, RunPod.  \n* Local Setups: Native installations on personal machines.  \n  This strategy requires careful management of file paths, environment configurations, and installation procedures to ensure a consistent experience on any platform.\n\n### **1.4. Scope and Language Focus**\n\nDevelopment prioritizes English-language versions of all components. Russian-specific files (e.g., widgets-ru.py, downloading-ru.py) from the original anxety-solo/sdAIgen repository are considered out of scope and will be ignored or removed. The focus is on creating new, language-agnostic components wherever possible.\n\n### **LLM Update Prompt**\n\n**SYSTEM PROMPT:** You are an AI assistant tasked with updating the \"Project Introduction\" chapter for the AnxLight project. Your goal is to provide a high-level overview that is accessible to new contributors. Using the provided context and any new information, please rewrite this chapter.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Update the Overview and Vision (Section 1.1):** Briefly state that AnxLight is a fork of anxety-solo/sdAIgen and its main purpose is to add a Gradio UI and refactor the backend for ease of use.  \n2. **Update the Core Goals (Section 1.2):** List the key objectives as bullet points. Focus on the move to a Gradio UI, simplifying the user experience, the \"v3\" architectural split, and making code modular.  \n3. **Update the Multi-Platform Strategy (Section 1.3):** Mention the target platforms (Colab, Kaggle, cloud services, local) and the importance of platform-agnostic design.  \n4. **Update the Scope and Language Focus (Section 1.4):** Clearly state that development is English-only and that Russian-language files from the original repository are out of scope.  \n5. Maintain a clear, concise, and professional tone throughout.\n\n## **Chapter 2: The \"v3\" Architecture**\n\n### **2.1. Architectural Philosophy**\n\nThe \"v3\" architecture represents a fundamental shift from the sequential script execution model of anxety-solo/sdAIgen. The new philosophy is centered on a clear separation of concerns, managed by a central Gradio UI. This design distinguishes between heavy, one-time installation tasks (Pre-Flight Setup) and the lighter, session-specific tasks of configuration and launching.\n\n### **2.2. Key Components (As of 2025-06-26)**\n\n* **1\\. Platform Entry Point (notebook/AnxLight\\_Launcher\\_v\\*.ipynb):** This is the user's starting point, simplified to a versioned, two-cell notebook.  \n  * **Cell 1: Pre-Flight Setup:** Clones/updates the AnxLight repository and executes the main setup script (scripts/pre\\_flight\\_setup.py) to perform all heavy, non-interactive tasks like VENV creation, dependency installation, and cloning WebUI repositories. This step is run once per environment.  \n  * **Cell 2: Application Launch:** Executes the main Gradio application (scripts/main\\_gradio\\_app.py) within the created VENV, starting the user's interactive session.  \n* **2\\. Pre-Flight Setup Script (scripts/pre\\_flight\\_setup.py):** This script is the workhorse for initial environment preparation. It handles installing system packages, creating a Python Virtual Environment (VENV), installing all core dependencies, and calling the individual, refactored WebUI installers from scripts/UIs/.  \n* **3\\. The Gradio User Interface (scripts/main\\_gradio\\_app.py):** This is the core of the AnxLight user experience. It serves as the configuration manager and application orchestrator. Its responsibilities include:  \n  * Reading and writing user selections to a anxlight\\_config.json file.  \n  * Handling session-specific asset downloads (models, LoRAs, etc.) using modules/Manager.py.  \n  * Displaying configuration options to the user in a graphical interface, using data from scripts/data/\\*.py.  \n  * Executing the final launch command for the selected WebUI via scripts/launch.py.  \n* **4\\. Core UI Installers (scripts/UIs/\\*.py):** The original scripts responsible for installing specific WebUIs have been refactored. All IPython-specific code has been removed, and shell commands are now executed using Python's standard subprocess module. This makes them callable from any Python script, decoupling them from the notebook environment.  \n* **5\\. Versioning Script (scripts/anxlight\\_version.py):** A new script that acts as the single source of truth for all component version numbers (e.g., ANXLIGHT\\_OVERALL\\_SYSTEM\\_VERSION, MAIN\\_GRADIO\\_APP\\_VERSION).  \n* **6\\. Data Modules (scripts/data/\\*.py):** Consolidated data sources for assets (e.g., sd15\\_data.py, sdxl\\_data.py), keeping asset information separate from the main application logic.\n\n### **2.3. Divergence from anxety-solo/sdAIgen**\n\nThe AnxLight v3 architecture is a significant and deliberate departure from its predecessor:\n\n| Feature | anxety-solo/sdAIgen (Original) | AnxLight (v3) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **User Interface** | IPython notebook cells executing Python scripts sequentially. | A unified Gradio application launched from a simple two-cell notebook. |\n| **Setup Flow** | A monolithic downloading-en.py script handles most tasks. | A two-stage process: pre\\_flight\\_setup.py for heavy installs and main\\_gradio\\_app.py for session tasks. |\n| **Modularity** | Tightly coupled scripts dependent on the notebook environment. | Decoupled, reusable scripts orchestrated by the main Gradio app. Scripts are refactored to use standard Python modules like subprocess. |\n| **Versioning** | No centralized version tracking. | A dedicated scripts/anxlight\\_version.py file serves as the single source of truth for the project version. |\n| **Configuration** | State managed implicitly through notebook execution order. | Explicit state managed via a anxlight\\_config.json file for persistence across sessions. |\n\n### **LLM Update Prompt**\n\n**SYSTEM PROMPT:** You are an AI assistant tasked with updating the \"v3 Architecture\" chapter for the AnxLight project. Your goal is to explain the technical architecture to a developer.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Update the Architectural Philosophy (Section 2.1):** Explain that v3 moves away from a linear script execution model to a separated one: a one-time \"pre-flight setup\" for heavy installs and a session-based Gradio app for configuration and launch.  \n2. **Update the Key Components (Section 2.2):** Detail the main parts of the system based on the latest information. Be sure to list and describe the purpose of the launcher notebook, pre\\_flight\\_setup.py, main\\_gradio\\_app.py, the refactored UI installers (scripts/UIs/\\*.py), the versioning script, and the data modules.  \n3. **Update the Divergence Table (Section 2.3):** Recreate the Markdown table comparing anxety-solo/sdAIgen with AnxLight (v3) across key features: UI, Setup Flow, Modularity, Versioning, and Configuration. Ensure the descriptions are concise and accurate.  \n4. Use code formatting for file paths and names (e.g., \\`scripts/main\\_gradio\\_app.py\\`).\n\n## **Chapter 3: Development Roadmap**\n\n### **3.1. Phase 1: Core Refactor and Foundation (Current)**\n\n* **Task:** Fully implement the \"v3\" architecture.  \n* **Status:** In Progress.  \n* **Key Goals:**  \n  * Finalize the pre\\_flight\\_setup.py script.  \n  * Develop the initial, functional version of the main\\_gradio\\_app.py UI.  \n  * Ensure all scripts/UIs/\\*.py are fully refactored and integrated.  \n  * Establish stable launch procedures for at least one primary WebUI (e.g., A1111).  \n  * Integrate the config.json for basic settings persistence.\n\n### **3.2. Phase 2: UI/UX Enhancement and Feature Expansion**\n\n* **Task:** Improve the user experience and add support for more tools.  \n* **Key Goals:**  \n  * Refine the Gradio UI for better layout, clarity, and user feedback.  \n  * Incorporate support for additional WebUIs and tools (e.g., ComfyUI, InvokeAI).  \n  * Develop a more advanced asset manager within the UI for models, LoRAs, and extensions.  \n  * Implement logic to save and load different user configurations.\n\n### **3.3. Phase 3: Advanced Features and Integrations**\n\n* **Task:** Introduce powerful new capabilities and integrations.  \n* **Key Goals:**  \n  * **Multi-UI Launch:** Allow users to run multiple WebUIs simultaneously.  \n  * **Resource Monitoring:** Add a dashboard to the UI to monitor system resources like VRAM and disk space.  \n  * **Cloud Storage Integration:** Enable syncing of models and configurations with services like Google Drive or S3.\n\n### **3.4. Long-Term Vision**\n\n* **Anx-Chain:** A potential future project to create a node-based workflow tool, similar to ComfyUI, but with a focus on orchestrating different applications and services.  \n* **Anx-Com:** A conceptual inter-process communication bus that would allow different AI applications (e.g., a WebUI and an upscaler) to communicate and work together seamlessly.\n\n### **LLM Update Prompt**\n\n**SYSTEM PROMPT:** You are an AI assistant tasked with updating the \"Development Roadmap\" chapter for the AnxLight project. Your purpose is to outline the planned progression of the project.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Update Phase 1 (Current):** Describe the immediate goals related to finalizing the v3 architecture. Mention tasks like completing pre\\_flight\\_setup.py, getting the Gradio app functional, and ensuring the refactored UI installers work.  \n2. **Update Phase 2 (Mid-Term):** Describe the next set of goals focused on improving the user experience. Mention enhancing the UI, adding support for more WebUIs, and building a better asset manager.  \n3. **Update Phase 3 (Advanced):** Describe advanced features. Mention concepts like multi-UI launching, resource monitoring, and cloud storage integration.  \n4. **Update the Long-Term Vision:** Briefly describe the conceptual future projects, such as \"Anx-Chain\" and \"Anx-Com\".  \n5. Structure the output using distinct phases and bullet points for clarity.\n\n## **Chapter 4: Technical Deep Dive**\n\n### **4.1. Configuration Management (anxlight\\_config.json)**\n\nThe anxlight\\_config.json file is central to the v3 architecture. It acts as a persistent state holder for the user's selections in the Gradio UI. This allows the application to remember settings across sessions and decouples the configuration from the execution logic. The Gradio app reads this file on startup to populate the UI and writes to it whenever the user makes changes.\n\n### **4.2. Versioning**\n\nTo maintain clarity and control over the project's evolution, a simple versioning system has been established. The file scripts/anxlight\\_version.py contains the current version string, acting as the single source of truth that can be imported and displayed within the application.\n\n### **LLM Update Prompt**\n\n**SYSTEM PROMPT:** You are an AI assistant tasked with updating the \"Technical Deep Dive\" chapter for the AnxLight project. This section is for explaining specific technical implementation details.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Update Configuration Management (Section 4.1):** Explain the role of the anxlight\\_config.json file. State that it's used by the Gradio app to save user selections between sessions, decoupling state from the application code.  \n2. **Update Versioning (Section 4.2):** Explain the purpose of the scripts/anxlight\\_version.py file. Describe it as the single source of truth for component version numbers, which helps in managing and displaying the project's current version.  \n3. If new, specific technical components are added to the project that require a detailed explanation, create new numbered subsections here to describe them.  \n4. Keep the explanations concise and focused on the \"how\" and \"why\" of the implementation.  \n*
