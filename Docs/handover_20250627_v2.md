# AnxLight Project - Handover Briefing - 2025-06-27 (v2)

## 1. Summary of Session

This session was marked by repeated failures to fix a critical `AttributeError` in the asset download functionality. Despite multiple attempts to patch the `modules/Manager.py` and `scripts/main_gradio_app.py` files, the error persists. The root cause was misdiagnosed several times, leading to a loop of incorrect fixes. The core issue lies in a faulty implementation of the `download_selected_assets` function, which prevents the Gradio application from functioning as intended. All attempts to rectify this have failed.

## 2. Key Actions & Changes Made

*   **Initial Diagnosis:** Correctly identified that `main_gradio_app.py` was calling a non-existent function (`download_selected_assets`) in the `Manager.py` module.
*   **Failed Fix #1 (Commit `2c1972b2`):** Incorrectly added the `download_selected_assets` function to `main_gradio_app.py` instead of `Manager.py`. This was a structural mistake.
*   **Failed Fix #2 (Commit `4d3b53f4`):** Correctly added the `download_selected_assets` function to `Manager.py` but introduced a new bug within it (an incorrect relative import `from ..scripts.data...`) which caused the module to fail loading.
*   **Failed Fix #3 (Commit `8a7e6f5g`):** Attempted to correct the import path within the function in `Manager.py`. This attempt also failed, as the `AttributeError` still occurs, indicating the module is still not loading correctly.
*   **Documentation of Failure (Commit `1a2b3c4d`):** Updated `Docs/Context.md` to reflect the persistent, unresolved critical issue.

## 3. Current System State & Confirmed Working Components

*   **Environment Setup (`pre_flight_setup.py`):** **Stable**. The environment and dependencies are installed correctly.
*   **Gradio Application (`main_gradio_app.py`):** **CRITICALLY BROKEN**. The application will launch but will immediately crash with an `AttributeError` as soon as the user tries to download assets and launch a WebUI. The asset download functionality is non-operational.

## 4. Immediate Blocker / Recommended Next Steps

*   **Blocker:** The system is unusable due to the persistent `AttributeError: module 'Manager' has no attribute 'download_selected_assets'`. This indicates that the `Manager.py` module is failing to load or be parsed correctly due to a bug within the `download_selected_assets` function that was recently added.

*   **Recommended Next Action:**
    1.  **DELETE a Function:** The entire `download_selected_assets` function at the bottom of the `modules/Manager.py` file is faulty and should be **deleted completely**.
    2.  **RE-IMPLEMENT LOGIC:** A new, clean implementation for asset downloading needs to be created. The logic should reside within `scripts/main_gradio_app.py` for simplicity, and it should call the known-working, lower-level functions from `Manager.py` (like `m_download`) with a properly constructed list of URLs.
    3.  **DO NOT TRUST THE RECENT COMMITS** to `Manager.py`. The error lies within them. The rest of the `Manager.py` file is likely stable.

## 5. Key Learnings & Pattern Recognition

*   **Compounding Errors:** A simple bug was made worse by a series of incorrect patches. A full rollback of the faulty logic and a fresh attempt is required.
*   **Module Import Errors:** The persistent `AttributeError` is a classic symptom of a module failing to import due to a syntax or import error within that module's file. The error doesn't show the *real* cause (the bad import in Manager.py) but rather the symptom (the main app can't find the function).
